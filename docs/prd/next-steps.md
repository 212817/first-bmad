# Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

> **UX Expert:** Please review this PRD and create a Design Architecture document. Focus on mobile-first, speed-optimized UI with emphasis on the one-tap save flow. Key screens: Home/Save, Confirmation, History, Detail, Settings, Login. Target WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility. Branding should be minimal and utilitarian—this is a utility app, not a social platform.

### Architect Prompt

> **Architect:** Please review this PRD and create a Technical Architecture document. Key technical decisions: React frontend (Vercel), Node.js backend (Vercel functions or Railway), PostgreSQL (Supabase/Neon), Cloudflare R2 for photos, Google/Apple OAuth. Monorepo structure. All services must use free tiers. Focus on the core save flow performance (≤5s) and photo handling (client-side compression, EXIF stripping, signed URLs).
