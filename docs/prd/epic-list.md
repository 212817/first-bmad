# Epic List

Based on the MVP scope, here are the proposed epics in logical, sequential order:

| Epic       | Title                       | Goal                                                                                               |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Epic 1** | Foundation & Authentication | Establish project infrastructure, deploy skeleton app, implement Google/Apple OAuth and Guest mode |
| **Epic 2** | Core Spot Saving            | Enable users to save their parking location with optional photo, note, and car tag                 |
| **Epic 3** | Navigation & Spot Retrieval | Allow users to view saved spots, navigate back via maps deep links, and manage spot history        |
| **Epic 4** | Sharing & Meter Timer       | Enable spot sharing with others and meter expiry reminders with notifications                      |
| **Epic 5** | Privacy, Settings & Polish  | Implement data management features, settings screen, and final polish for launch                   |

**Rationale:**

- **4 main content epics + 1 polish epic** keeps scope manageable
- Each epic delivers deployable, testable functionality
- Epic 1 establishes foundation so subsequent epics can build incrementally
- Core value (save + navigate) is delivered by end of Epic 3
- Sharing and timer are valuable but secondary; grouped in Epic 4
- Privacy controls and settings are critical for launch but can be built last
