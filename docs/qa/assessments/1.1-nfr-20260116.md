## Summary

| NFR             | Status  | Notes                                                   |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Security        | ✅ PASS | Helmet, CORS, Zod validation, no secrets in code        |
| Performance     | ✅ PASS | Infrastructure story - no performance-critical code yet |
| Reliability     | ✅ PASS | Error handling, health check, graceful error responses  |
| Maintainability | ✅ PASS | Strict TypeScript, ESLint, tests, comprehensive docs    |

**Quality Score**: 100/100

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Security ✅ PASS

**Evidence Found:**

- ✅ Helmet middleware applied for security headers
- ✅ CORS configured with origin whitelist validation
- ✅ Environment variables validated with Zod schema
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets (DATABASE_URL from env)
- ✅ Error responses hide stack traces in production
- ⚠️ Rate limiting not yet implemented (appropriate - no auth endpoints yet)

**Notes**: Security foundation is solid. Rate limiting should be added when auth endpoints are introduced (Story 1.2+).

### 2. Performance ✅ PASS

**Evidence Found:**

- ✅ JSON body limit set (10mb) - prevents oversized payloads
- ✅ Health endpoint lightweight and fast
- ✅ Neon PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- ✅ Vercel Edge deployment (low latency)

**Notes**: Infrastructure story - no performance-critical business logic yet. Foundation supports future performance needs.

### 3. Reliability ✅ PASS

**Evidence Found:**

- ✅ Centralized error middleware with typed responses
- ✅ Health endpoint with database connectivity check
- ✅ AppError class for consistent error handling
- ✅ 404 handler for unknown routes
- ✅ Graceful degradation (503 when DB unhealthy)

**Notes**: Error handling patterns established. Health check enables monitoring integration.

### 4. Maintainability ✅ PASS

**Evidence Found:**

- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ✅ ESLint 9.x flat config with React/TypeScript rules
- ✅ Prettier for consistent formatting
- ✅ Monorepo structure with shared packages
- ✅ CI pipeline (lint, format, build, test)
- ✅ Integration test for health endpoint
- ✅ Comprehensive README documentation

**Notes**: Excellent foundation for maintainability. Test coverage will grow with feature stories.

## Critical Issues

None.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Future**: Add rate limiting when auth endpoints are introduced
2. **Future**: Add Sentry for error tracking per monitoring architecture
3. **Future**: Configure Uptime Robot for health check monitoring
